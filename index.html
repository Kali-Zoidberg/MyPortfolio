      Hello, my name is Nicholas Chow. This website is a portfolio of my personal, academic projects, as well as other interests of mine.

        <h2 align='center' style="background-color: #2f6a6b">Computer Science</h2>
      &nbsp&nbspMy interest in Computer Science first began at the age of 13. Most of my exposure to the
      field was in the form of video game modding
      and hardware modifications for video game consoles. While in high school, I explored video game development
      with Unity and taught myself Java. Following my high school graduation, I started my college experience at UC Merced and ended it at UC Irvine.
      Through these schools I have taken courses in Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Information Retrieval, Project in Web Applications (Full Stack),
      Computer and Network Security, as well as Database Management. I have explored many different languages and technologies within Computer Science as described below.

        I'm really into classic cars, specifically wedge shaped cars. A lot of my downtime is spent working on my 1986 Nissan 300ZX Z31.
        On this website, you may find various blurbs, tutorials, and/or pictures in regards to my car.

        <h2 align = 'center' style="background-color: #2f6a6b;">Detailing</h2>
        Part of my love for cars spawns from my meticulous attitude towards car paint. I detail cars as both a hobby and job.
      <br>
      I offer services for the following:  paint correction, headlight restoration, interior cleaning, and exterior cleaning.
